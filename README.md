# imageWall
 A processing sketch for displaying image files in an automatic slideshow  
 The generated image is streamed through Syphon

 Requirements:
 - Processing (processing.org)
 - Syphon library (can be installed through the internal library manager)

 Put a bunch of images (*.jpg or *.png) in the imgs folder. Whatever their filename is, is displayed as the caption.
 You can avoid duplicate filenames by adding `-randomcharacters` after the name, but before the extension, that text will be hidden. For example: `myfilename-jkdshf.png`
